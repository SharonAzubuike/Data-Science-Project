# Data-Science-Project
The data set is a cardiovascular data set. The data set was obtained from Research Gate after a long search for quantitative data.
As a cardiovascular scientist, I set out to carry out linear and logistic regression, find corellations between systolic blood pressure, age,family history, alcohol consumption, obesity AND chronic heart disease 
I could carry out the preliminary data exploratory, data cleaning process, visualization and feature Engineering.
I could carry out clustering of my data set using KMeans.
I split my data set into test and train data, trained my model and tested my model. 
I was able to use my model to test for accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.
This study was done in partial fulfillment of my certification by ReDI, Munich as having undergone the Data Science course/Training. 
I am thankful to my Teachers at ReDI who have taken the time to teach indepth concepts of data science and machine learning. As I to apply these concepts to even larger data sets, I hope to make my Teachers and Mentors very proud. Special thanks also goes to the organisers and Funders of ReDI School Munich for all efforts to enhance learning and employability of students.
The learning continues after this. I am headed for the top.
